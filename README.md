# face_recognition-using-dlib-and-opencv

Step1: Create your own dataset by creating individual floder for each person. Keep 5-10 images per person.
Step2: Create encode_faces.py to encode faces and generate pickle file. This file must be execute through command prompt. And it takes large amout of time to quantify all faces.
       I developed this project in googlecolab.
Step3: Create recognize_faces_image.py to test the image. It also executed from command prompt
